Fresh from the Farm. Fresh from the Farm is an online shopping web application where customer gets an opportunity to buy their wishful products which will 
be delivered straight from the farmers. Also, farmers get a platform to showcase their products in our website with setting their tentative prices as well. 
Our website is agent free website i.e., there is no agent involved in between farmers and customers, there is a direct interaction between farmers and customers.


Our application is a two-way forum i.e., farmers and customers. Both ways have their own functionalities and uses and both are fully fledged. Initially, our 
home page is the first page which is displayed to the users. In our home page, we have provided a nav bar where all the sections are displayed. We have the 
home section, Products section, Farmer’s, section and the contact us section. Below this we have kept some of the products of our website which will allow 
users to have a look on what all products and what basic prices are given. Users will get an information about our website through the home page itself.


Secondly, we have included the first module which is the customer’s module. Customers get a chance to view all the products which include vegetables and fruits 
from the Products section. Each product is displayed with its price per kg or price per dozen and a add to cart button as well. Customers can add the products 
of their choices by clicking this add to cart button. Before entering the cart section, Customers have to login to our account for their verification and if the 
Customer is new to our site, then he/she has to signup so that we will have his/her record in our database as well. After successful login, cart section is enabled 
where by clicking the cart button Customers can view their product list with the total amount and a proceed to checkout button. Our cart shows customers all the 
products that he/she as selected in the table format where name of the product, its price per quantity and the total amount in Rs as well. We have also provided 
proceed to checkout button and the clear cart button below the table. Clear cart button will clear the existing cart and proceed to checkout button will move the 
Customers to the payment gateway process. Customer needs to enter his/her name, address, card details and the CVV so that he/she can now proceed to a successful 
payment. After the successful payment is achieved, the products will be delivered to the Customers directly within 15 mins. Customers will also get the bill of 
their shopping as well.


Thirdly, we have included the farmer’s module. Farmers a crucial part of our website. They are the ones which will provide the products so as to be displayed 
to the customers. By moving to the Farmer’s section, we come across 4 main sub-sections. It includes Farmer’s registration, add products to our website, checking 
uploaded products and checking revenue. Before entering any of the section, farmers will have to login through their accounts in our site and if they are new to 
our website, they will have to create their accounts. First of all, Farmers have to register to our website as this registration will save their records in our 
database system, they have to enter their self-details as well as bank details as well, so when the amount will be

 
disbursed according to the sale, the money will be transferred directly to their bank accounts. Secondly, farmers get an opportunity to add their products in our 
website by clicking the add products section. Here farmers have to choose their product with the quantity they are willing to provide, they also have a chance to 
decide their amount per kg so that they will not feel cheated due to some fix rates. We also have the check uploads sections where farmers can view all the products 
which he/she has uploaded in our website with it’s quantity. Farmers also can check and collect the revenue disbursed to them at the end of each day by checking the revenue section.


In this way, we have provided an equal opportunity to the customers and farmers. Both can have a reasonable profit and a well devised service through our website.

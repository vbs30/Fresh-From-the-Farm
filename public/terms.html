        <h2>1. Revenue policy</h2>
        <p>
            Customers who buy the product would be segregated by their city.
        Farmer who would be located near or in the city will be considered as the seller and the product will be picked
        up from these farmers respectively.
        Farmers will get their share at the end of the day.
        Revenue would be ditributed to the farmers on the basis of their product selling i.e they will be shared with
        the Revenue
        on the basis of daily selling.
        Number of products that farmer has sold would be saved in the database
        and all the total money will be provided to him in his bank account at the end of the day.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>2. Product Addition</h2>
        <p>
            Farmer can upload his/her product in our website through the add product section.
        According to our norms, products must be uploaded in a multiple of 5kg.
        Farmer have to first add their username so that our site would verify if the farmer is really eligible to upload
        his/her products.
        Our pickup and delivery team would then seek the farmers according to the customer's need.
        For example, A farmer has suppose added a product namely "Potato" with quantity as 25kg,
        He has a good chance of adding it to our product display page as the quantity will be proven good 
        by our maintainance team. Our team will go on sight and check the items which are added to the product display by the farmers.
